	<h1>Brief Introduction to HEMA(Historical European Martial Arts)</h1>
    <p><strong>HEMA</strong> is a form of martial arts that encompasses dozens of different
	 styles of combat from Italian, German, British, French, Spanish, Scottish and
	 Portuguese schools that were developed between the 14th and 19th century. The styles of 
	 martial arts include both hand-to-hand/wrestling as well as techniques involving swords, daggers,
	 spears, long knives and axes. Today there are several HEMA federations that host championships yearly
	  for this martial art. To learn more about the history of <strong>HEMA</strong> you can read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_European_martial_arts"
